                What is Love? The eternal question we all carry around deep within our heart. Love is the eternal
                search. Love is eternal when we find it. But do we really ever find it ? When we define it do we negate
                it? When we set limits on what we believe to be love do we begin to destroy it by hoping to understand
                or own it for ourselves? We offer it through all of our relationship we vary our giving, often by what
                we hope to receive in return. But is this really love?

            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="list">I recently overheard someone say in a conversation that
                there is no such thing as “ unconditional love .” I would have to agree, although for different reasons.
                Love within itself is unconditional. Anything else is only an attempt to love, a learning to get us
                nearer to the one true knowing of love. It may be honorable, well-intentioned, passionate and desiring,
                courageous and pure. It may be felt as temporary, but if lost easily it may not have been love at all.
                Love cannot be thwarted and often fall short of what we hope love will be. This is where we learn we are
                human.

                has been experienced as being the very notes of song, uplifting and generous to the wanting ear. Love
                has been experienced as the final act of giving one’s life for another in battle. Love has been
                experienced as an endless passionate over flow of emotion in the arms of waiting lover.
